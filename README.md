OpenBCI 3D-printable EEG headset files

- This repository contains the latest versions of Spiderclaw, the OpenBCI 3D-printable EEG headset.
- The design has not yet been updated to work with the latest version of the hardware (V3, the Kickstarter/pre-order release)
- New design coming soon (exp. Spring 2015)!

Version 1 - December 2013

Version 2 - April 2014

For V2 we used the following screws to fasten the OpenBCI board to the Spiderclaw: http://www.mcmaster.com/#99461a282/=unyhey

The holes on the V3 board are slightly bigger, so a larger screw may work better.
